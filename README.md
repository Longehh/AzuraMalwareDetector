# AzuraX Malware Detector
___
### Description:
- A simple JavaFX Program that detects malware in a file. To run the detector simply double click the file, or `java -jar MalwareScanner-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in command-line.
- The program will prompt you to select a file to scan, and will output the results in the console.

### Current Detections:
- Hostflow - Checks for the presence of Java Assist, and whether the JAR file is opening a web socket to the Hostflow Servers.
- Exfilteration - Checks for the presence of network calls such as Web Sockets, HTTP, and HTTPS requests. (**Please Note**: This is just an indication of what it's doing and requires further examination. Plugins with license systems will also flag this).
- System Calls - Checks for the presence of system calls, such as `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, `ProcessBuilder`. (**Please Note**: This is just an indication of what it's doing and requires further examination).
