# AzuraX Malware Detector
___
### Description:
- A simple JavaFX Program that detects malware in a file or directory. To run the detector simply double click the file, or `java -jar MalwareScanner-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in command-line.
- The program will prompt you to select a file to scan, and will output the results in the console.

### Current Detections:
- Hostflow - Checks for the presence of Java Assist, and whether the JAR file is opening a web socket to the Hostflow Servers.
- Exfilteration - Checks for the presence of network calls such as `Web Sockets`, `HTTP`, and `HTTPS` requests. (**Please Note**: This is just an indication of what it's doing and requires further examination. Plugins with license systems will also flag this).
- System Calls - Checks for the presence of system calls, such as `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, `ProcessBuilder`. (**Please Note**: This is just an indication of what it's doing and requires further examination).

### Disclaimer:
- This program is not perfect, and should not be used as a sole detection method. It is recommended to use this program in conjunction with other detection methods.
- In conjunction with this program unless it's Hostflow you should investigate the flag via manual code review.

### Future Plans:
- Add more detections.
- Add the ability to recursively scan directories.
- Add the ability to modify the Bytecode of the JAR file to remove the malware.
